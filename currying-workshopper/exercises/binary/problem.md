## Task

Write a function that takes two arguments and returns their sum.

----------------------------------------------------------------------
## HINTS

By now you know how to write a function and expose it as a Node module.

Binary functions are functions that accept two arguments.

For example:
```js
var binary = function (firstArg, secArg) {
  // your logic
}
```

When you are done, you must run:
```sh
$ {appname} verify program.js
```

to proceed. Your program will be tested, a report will be generated, and the
lesson will be marked 'completed' if you are successful.

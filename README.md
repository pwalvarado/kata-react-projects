# AWS Amplify + Serverless Demo + Vue.js

## Introduction

Small project to learn how to integrate AWS Amplify + Serverless lambdas in a VueJS environment. Following these steps [Serverless Functions In Depth
](https://read.acloud.guru/serverless-functions-in-depth-507439b4be88).

In this repo, youâ€™ll find the fundamentals of serverless functions & serverless
applications. While this is focused on front-end developers new to the serverless
space, this is a good deep dive for anyone looking to learn more about serverless
functions in general.

## Requirements

You will need the [Amplify CLI](https://aws-amplify.github.io/docs/cli-toolchain/quickstart) installed globally _with NPM_. Using Yarn gives an error in the setup (as of Dec. 2019).

This uses the [Shiba.Online API](https://shibe.online/), but feel free to use another one of your choice. This is meant to be a boilerplate/demo only.
